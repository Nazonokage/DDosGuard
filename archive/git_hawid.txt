Glad it worked, mate! Here’s the full list of PowerShell commands you can use for future reference. You can save these in your archive for later use.

### **📌 Steps to Upload a Missing Folder (Windows PowerShell)**
1️⃣ **Check if `frontend` is ignored**  
Run this to see if `frontend` is listed in `.gitignore`:  
```powershell
cat .gitignore
```
- If found, **edit `.gitignore`** and remove `frontend/` or `frontend/*`.

---

2️⃣ **Add the frontend folder to Git**  
Run:
```powershell
git add frontend
git commit -m "Adding frontend files"
git push origin main
```

---

3️⃣ **If Git still ignores the files, force add them**  
```powershell
git add frontend/*
git commit -m "Forcing Git to track frontend files"
git push origin main
```

---

4️⃣ **If files still don’t show, reset and retry**  
```powershell
git rm -r --cached frontend
git add frontend
git commit -m "Re-adding frontend"
git push origin main
```

---

This will make sure the frontend folder gets tracked properly and uploaded to GitHub. 🚀
