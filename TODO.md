# Performance Optimization TODO List

## High Priority
- [ ] **Interval Optimization**: Reduce setInterval frequency from 1s to 100ms for smoother updates, add proper cleanup
- [ ] **Memoization**: Add React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] **Chart Debouncing**: Debounce chart data updates to reduce rendering overhead
- [ ] **Terminal Virtualization**: Implement virtual scrolling for terminal logs to handle large log volumes

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **Component Splitting**: Break down large simulation components into smaller, focused components
- [ ] **State Optimization**: Use useReducer for complex state management in simulations
- [ ] **Memory Leak Prevention**: Ensure all intervals and event listeners are properly cleaned up
- [ ] **Bundle Splitting**: Implement code splitting for simulation components

## Low Priority
- [ ] **Image Optimization**: Optimize and lazy load images
- [ ] **CSS Optimization**: Remove unused CSS and optimize animations
- [ ] **Service Worker**: Add service worker for caching static assets

## Completed
- [x] **Lazy Loading**: Already implemented for route components
