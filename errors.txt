# Vercel Deployment Issues - FIXED! ✅

## Issues Identified & Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Missing "dev" script error
- **Problem**: Package.json was missing the "dev" script
- **Solution**: Added proper Vite scripts to package.json

### 2. ✅ ESLint "react-app" config error  
- **Problem**: ESLint was trying to load "react-app" config which doesn't exist in Vite
- **Solution**: Created new eslint.config.cjs with basic ESLint rules

### 3. ✅ Vercel deployment configuration
- **Problem**: Vercel wasn't properly configured for Vite
- **Solution**: Added vercel.json with proper build settings and SPA routing

### 4. ✅ Build command mismatch
- **Problem**: Still using "react-scripts build" instead of "vite build"
- **Solution**: Updated package.json scripts to use Vite commands

## Files Created/Updated:

1. **vercel.json** - Vercel deployment configuration
2. **eslint.config.cjs** - ESLint configuration for Vite
3. **package.json** - Updated scripts for Vite
4. **vite.config.js** - Already configured properly

## Next Steps:
1. Commit and push these changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. The deployment should now work successfully!
